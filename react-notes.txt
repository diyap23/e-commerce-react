React :
- external library
- helps us to create website easier

External Library :
- code that is outside our computer
- code that someonw else wrote

React : shared features
React dom : features specific to websites

render : display 

babel :
- javascript compiler
- translate jsx to js

 ReactDOM.createRoot(container).render(div); --  place the element you want to display in the render()

 /***** COMPONENTS *****/
 - a piece of website  <ChatInput></ChatInput> 
 - create our own html elements
 - components name must start with a capital letter
 -  must be in pascal case (PascalCase)

 <input /> = <input></input>

 - we can only return one value in the function

  <ChatInput></ChatInput> - Component Syntax

  <> : Fragments 

  props : property = every component function gets one parameter  
  - props parameter is an object 
  - it contains all the attributes that we give to the component
  - props make our component reusable

  -- best practice is to use component(App) to create the website
  
  Destructing, Guard Operator(&&)

  /****** STATE ******/
  - helps to make our website interactive
  -

  .map() - let us go through each value of an array and convert it into a 
  new value

  [
    value1, ----------- newValue1,
    value2, ----------- newValue2,
  ]

  arrow function => works the same way as function, but its shorter

  /****** EVENT HANDLERS ******/
  - run a fucntion when we interact with the website
  {} = save any type of value in a prop (including a function)
  .push() => add the value at the end of an array

  crypto.randomUUID() : generate the unique ID string

  ... -> Spread Operator : takes the value in an array, and copies them 
  into a new array

  /******** STATE ********/
  - State = data that is connected to the HTML
  - When we update this data, it will update the HTML 
  - state = save data that change over time

  onChange : runs a function when we change the text inside an <input>

  event.target = gives us the element that we're typing in


  LIFTING THE STATE UP : share state between multiple components

  {} = save any type of value inside the prop

  controlled input = remove the input text from the input area once it is submitted
  
  value = change the text inside this <input>


  /****** ROUTING ******/
  - create multiple pages in React
  
  <Routes> : tells React all the pages that are in our website
